Hello everyone, I am a second year Electronic Engineering Student at The University of Manchester.

I am currently learning C, C++ and VHDL as part of my studies. I am just starting to explore these as part of my personal projects, which I will document on *this* profile.

I did have a separate account connected to my university work, but I have since deleted this and I am in the process of moving the projects I want to keep to this account as well.

Currently both my profile and knowledge are relatively bare, but I look forward to expanding it in the future!
